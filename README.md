### 👋 Hello there!

I'm Harika, an Embedded Firmware & VLSI Design Engineer with 2+ years of hands-on industry experience, currently completing my Master’s in Electrical and Computer Engineering at San Francisco State University (GPA: 3.71).

With a strong foundation in **ADAS testing**, **FPGA design**, and **ASIC implementation**, I’m passionate about building scalable, real-time embedded solutions and pushing the limits of silicon performance. My journey spans **camera module testing for automotive OEMs**, **RFID train communication systems**, and **backend flows for NVDLA ASIC design**.
